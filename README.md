# Text Compression Project in C++

## Project Overview

This project implements a text compression algorithm using C++. The primary goal is to reduce the size of text files while maintaining the integrity of the original content. The project leverages various C++ standard libraries to efficiently handle file input/output, string manipulation, and data structures.

## Features

- **Efficient Compression**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to compress text files effectively.
- **Modular Design**: The project is structured using C++ modules for better organization and maintainability.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on any platform that supports C++.

## Modules Used

- `iostream`: For standard input and output operations.
- `string`: To handle and manipulate strings.
- `sstream`: For string stream operations, allowing easy conversion between strings and other data types.
- `map`: To store and manage frequency maps for characters.
- `fstream`: For file handling, enabling reading from and writing to files.
- `vector`: To manage dynamic arrays for storing data.
- `compression_map`: A custom module that implements the compression algorithm.
